##  Validate Binary Search Tree
This question asks to check whether a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). A valid BST satisfies the property that every nodeâ€™s value must be greater than all values in its left subtree and less than all values in its right subtree.

The solution uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) strategy while maintaining bounds (min < node.val < max) for each node.

**Understand**
You are given the root of a binary tree. Determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

In a valid BST:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value.

- The right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.

- Both the left and right subtrees must also be valid BSTs.

**Match**
This problem fits the pattern of:

- Tree traversal (DFS)

- Bounds checking at each node

- Recursive validation based on constraints

**Plan**
- Use DFS to traverse the tree.

- Maintain two bounds: left and right.

- For each node, check that left < node.val < right.

- Recursively apply the same logic:

    - For the left child, update the right bound to node.val.

    - For the right child, update the left bound to node.val.

- Return True only if all nodes satisfy the BST conditions.
