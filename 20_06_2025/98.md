##  Validate Binary Search Tree
This question asks to check whether a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). A valid BST satisfies the property that every nodeâ€™s value must be greater than all values in its left subtree and less than all values in its right subtree.

The solution uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) strategy while maintaining bounds (min < node.val < max) for each node.

**Understand**
You are given the root of a binary tree. Determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

In a valid BST:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value.

The right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.

Both the left and right subtrees must also be valid BSTs.

**Match**
This problem fits the pattern of:

Tree traversal (DFS)

Bounds checking at each node

Recursive validation based on constraints
