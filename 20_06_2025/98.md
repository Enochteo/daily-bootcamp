##  Validate Binary Search Tree
This question asks to check whether a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). A valid BST satisfies the property that every nodeâ€™s value must be greater than all values in its left subtree and less than all values in its right subtree.

The solution uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) strategy while maintaining bounds (min < node.val < max) for each node.
