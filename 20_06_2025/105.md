Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
This project reconstructs a binary tree given its preorder and inorder traversal sequences. The tree is built using a recursive approach that leverages the traversal properties and efficiently constructs left and right subtrees.

**Understand**
Given two lists:

preorder: Nodes visited in root → left → right order

inorder: Nodes visited in left → root → right order

You need to construct the original binary tree and return its root node.

**Match**
This problem fits the pattern of:

Divide and conquer in trees

Recursive tree construction

Traversal-based binary tree logic

Use of deque for efficient O(1) pops from preorder
