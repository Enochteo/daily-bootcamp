## Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache
This project implements an efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache data structure. The LRU cache supports constant time get and put operations using a combination of a hashmap and a doubly linked list.

**Understand**
The LRU cache evicts the least recently used item when it exceeds its capacity. It should support:

- get(key): Returns the value of the key if it exists, otherwise returns -1.

- put(key, value): Inserts or updates the value of the key. If the cache exceeds capacity, the least recently used item is removed.
