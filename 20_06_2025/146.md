## Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache
This project implements an efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache data structure. The LRU cache supports constant time get and put operations using a combination of a hashmap and a doubly linked list.

**Understand**
The LRU cache evicts the least recently used item when it exceeds its capacity. It should support:

- get(key): Returns the value of the key if it exists, otherwise returns -1.

- put(key, value): Inserts or updates the value of the key. If the cache exceeds capacity, the least recently used item is removed.

**Match**
This problem is a classic example of:

- Cache design

- Hashmap + Doubly Linked List combo

- Constant-time operations for both access and updates

- Recently-used item tracking with ordering

**Plan**
- Use a hashmap to map keys to nodes for O(1) access.

- Use a doubly linked list to maintain the order of usage.

    - The most recently used (MRU) item is at the tail (right).

    - The least recently used (LRU) item is at the head (left).

- Each time get() or put() is called, update the node to MRU position.

- When the cache exceeds capacity, remove the node just after the head.
