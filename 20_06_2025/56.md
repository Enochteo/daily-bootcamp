## Merge Intervals
This project solves the classic Merge Intervals problem. Given a list of intervals where some may overlap, the goal is to merge all overlapping intervals and return a list of the merged intervals.

**Understand**
You're given a list of intervals [[start1, end1], [start2, end2], ...].

If any two intervals overlap (i.e. start2 <= end1), merge them into one.

Return a list of non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

**Match**
This problem fits the pattern of:

Sorting + Iteration

Greedy Merging of overlapping segments

Common in interval-based scheduling or timeline problems
