## Max Consecutive Ones III
**Understand**
The problem is to return the maximum number of consecutive 1s you can get after flipping at most k zeros
Input: An array of 0s and 1s, A number k, which is the maximum number of 0s we can flip to 1s.
Output: the maximum number of consecutive 1s you can get after flipping at most k zeros

**Match**
This is a sliding window problem where:
The window contains at most k zeros.
We’re looking for the maximum size of such a valid window.

**Plan**
Use a Sliding Window:
Keep two pointers: left and right.

Move right to extend the window.

For each 0 at right, use 1 flip (reduce k).

If k < 0: we’ve used more than k flips. Move left to shrink the window until it becomes valid again (flip count ≤ k).

At each step, update the maximum length (right - left + 1).
