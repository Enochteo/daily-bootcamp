## 3 Sum
**Understand**
The problem was an extension of two sum and two sum II. It was to find and return three indices such that their sum equalled zero.

**Match**
- The question involves knowledge from hash table, two pointer and some sorting.

**Plan**
- We would first sort the numbers
- then we would fix each value and then find all other possible two sums all of which their sum would equal zero.
- The catch is we have to make sure the number we have fixed is not a duplicate.

**Implement**
- create a value for the result
- sort the list
- iterate the list using both the indexes and the numbers
- if the number is a duplicate (duplicates would be beside each other we skip).
