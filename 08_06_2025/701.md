## Insert into a binary search tree
Understand:
The problem is to insert a value correctly into its right position in an already made binary search tree.
Input: The root of an already made binary search tree, Value to be inputed
Outpu: The root of the resulting binary tree after the value has been correctly inputed.

Match:
The problem involves knowledge from binary search trees, traversals and getting the leftmost value of a subtree.

Plan:
- The plan would be to traverse the tree recursively till you get to the correct leaf. The idea is to use the principle from binary search to get to the correct leaf.
- After this we return the root to be inputed into its correct position: left or right as determined by the binary search.
