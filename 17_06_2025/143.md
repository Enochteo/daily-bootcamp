## Reorder List
https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/

Given the head of a singly linked list, reorder it in-place such that
the nodes are rearranged in this specific order:
`L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → ...`
Do not return anything — modify the list in-place.

#### Understand
We were given a singly linked list.
Our goal is to reorder its nodes by alternating from the front and
back, without creating new nodes or using extra space.

**Input**: head of the list

**Output**: Reordered list, in-place

**Constraints**:
Do not use extra space
Only modify .next pointers
Return type is None

**Example**:
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
Output: 1 → 5 → 2 → 4 → 3

### Match
This is a linked list manipulation problem involving:
Middle detection using slow/fast pointers
Reversing a sublist
Merging two lists in-place
No extra memory is allowed → O(1) space → suggests pointer manipulation.

### Plan
Use slow and fast pointers to find the middle node.

Reverse the second half of the list starting after the middle.

Merge the first half and the reversed second half, alternating nodes.

Set the last node's .next to None to terminate the list.
