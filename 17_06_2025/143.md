## Reorder List
https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/

Given the head of a singly linked list, reorder it in-place such that
the nodes are rearranged in this specific order:
`L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → ...`
Do not return anything — modify the list in-place.

#### Understand
We were given a singly linked list.
Our goal is to reorder its nodes by alternating from the front and
back, without creating new nodes or using extra space.

**Input**: head of the list

**Output**: Reordered list, in-place

**Constraints**:
Do not use extra space
Only modify .next pointers
Return type is None

**Example**:
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
Output: 1 → 5 → 2 → 4 → 3
