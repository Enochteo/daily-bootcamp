## Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
(https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

Given a rotated sorted array with no duplicates, find the minimum
element in **O(log n)** time.

#### **Understand**
We are given a sorted array that's been rotated at some unknown pivot.
Our task is to return the smallest element in this array.
- Input: An array of integers `nums` (sorted and rotated).
- Output: The **minimum element** in the array.
- Constraint: Must run in **O(log n)** time.

Example:
`nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` â†’ output: `0`

#### **Match**
This is a classic **Binary Search** problem disguised in rotation.
The Array is partially sorted and the goal is to find a special value using **logarithmic time** ->
suggests Binary Search.
