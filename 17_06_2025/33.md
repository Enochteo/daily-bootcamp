## Search in Rotated Sorted Array - Neetcode 150

https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Given a rotated sorted array with no duplicates, return the index of a
target value. If not found, return -1. The solution must run in O(log
n) time.

---

#### Understand

We are given:

A sorted array that was rotated at some unknown pivot

A target value to search for
We must return the index of the target in O(log n) time or -1 if not found.

Example:
`nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`, `target = 0` â†’ output: `4`

---
#### Match

This is a Binary Search problem with a twist:

The array is rotated and partially sorted

We can't directly apply regular binary search until we find the rotation pivot

After that, we determine whether to search in the left or right subarray
