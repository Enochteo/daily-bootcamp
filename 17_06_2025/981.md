## Time Based Key-Value Store
https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/

Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple
values for the same key at different timestamps, and retrieve the
value for a key at a given timestamp (or the most recent one before
it).

**Understand**
Implement a class with two methods:
set(key, value, timestamp): Store a value with a key at a specific time.

get(key, timestamp): Retrieve the most recent value for that key where
the stored timestamp is less than or equal to the given timestamp.

Input: key: str, value: str, timestamp: int

Output: A string representing the value at or before the given timestamp

Constraint: Must handle up to 2 * 10⁵ operations efficiently

Example:
```python
CopyEdit
set("foo", "bar", 1)
get("foo", 1) => "bar"
get("foo", 3) => "bar"
set("foo", "bar2", 4)
get("foo", 4) => "bar2"
get("foo", 5) => "bar2"
```
