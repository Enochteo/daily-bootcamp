## Reverse Linked List (Recursive Approach)
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the new head. This version solves the problem using a recursive approach.

**Understand**
We are given a singly linked list and must reverse its node order.

Input: Head of a singly linked list

Output: New head of the reversed list

Constraints:

Must reverse the list by modifying the .next pointers

No new nodes should be created

Example:
Input: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`
Output:`5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`
