## Subtree of Another Tree
This question is to determine whether one binary tree is a subtree of another. It uses a recursive depth-first search approach to compare structure and values between the main tree and the potential subtree.

**Understand**
We are given two binary trees: root and subRoot. We need to determine whether subRoot is a subtree of root.

A subtree is defined as a node in root such that the tree rooted at that node is structurally identical to subRoot.
