## Good Nodes in a Binary Tree
This project counts the number of "good" nodes in a binary tree. A node X is considered good if there are no nodes with a greater value than X on the path from the root to X. The problem is solved using depth-first search (DFS) and follows the UMPIRE framework.

**Understand**
You are given the root of a binary tree. A node is called good if the value on the path from the root to that node is always less than or equal to the nodeâ€™s value.

We need to count how many such nodes exist in the tree.

**Match**
This problem fits the pattern of:

Tree traversal (DFS)

Keeping track of state (maximum value) along the path

Simple recursive design
