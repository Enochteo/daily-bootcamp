## Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
This project solves the problem of finding the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a Binary Search Tree (BST) using a single-pass recursive solution. The approach leverages the properties of BSTs to efficiently determine the LCA.

**Understand**
You are given the root of a Binary Search Tree and two nodes p and q. You must return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.

In a BST:

The left subtree of a node contains values less than the node's value.

The right subtree contains values greater than the node's value.

The LCA is the lowest node in the tree that has both p and q as descendants (a node can be a descendant of itself).

**Match**
This problem matches the following patterns:

Binary Search Tree traversal

Recursive tree processing

Decision-based traversal using value comparisons

It leverages the BST's sorted structure to eliminate unnecessary paths.

**Plan**
If the current root is None, return None.

If both p and q are less than the root, the LCA is in the left subtree.

If both p and q are greater than the root, the LCA is in the right subtree.

Otherwise, the current root is the split point and is the lowest common ancestor.
