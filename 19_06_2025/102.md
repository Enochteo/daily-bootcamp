## Level Order Traversal of a Binary Tree
This project performs a level order traversal (also known as Breadth-First Search) of a binary tree and returns the values of nodes at each level as a list of lists. The solution uses a queue-based approach and follows the UMPIRE framework.

**Understand**
Given the root of a binary tree, return its level order traversalâ€”that is, the node values at each level from top to bottom, left to right.

For example, given this tree:

```markdown
       3
      / \
     9  20
        / \
       15  7
```
The output should be: [[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]
