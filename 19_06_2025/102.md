## Level Order Traversal of a Binary Tree
This project performs a level order traversal (also known as Breadth-First Search) of a binary tree and returns the values of nodes at each level as a list of lists. The solution uses a queue-based approach and follows the UMPIRE framework.

**Understand**
Given the root of a binary tree, return its level order traversal—that is, the node values at each level from top to bottom, left to right.

For example, given this tree:

```markdown
       3
      / \
     9  20
        / \
       15  7
```
The output should be: [[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]


Match
This problem matches the following patterns:

Tree traversal

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Queue usage to manage traversal order by level

Data structure used: Queue (deque)
Traversal type: Level Order

**Plan**
Check if the root is None. If so, return an empty list.

Initialize a queue with the root node.

While the queue is not empty:

Create a list to hold the current level’s values.

For each node in the queue at the current level:

Pop it from the queue.

Add its value to the level list.

Add its children to the queue.

Append the level list to the result.

Return the result list.
