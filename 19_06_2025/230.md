## Kth Smallest Element in a BST
This project solves the problem of finding the kth smallest element in a Binary Search Tree (BST) using in-order traversal and follows the UMPIRE problem-solving framework.

**Understand**
We are given the root of a Binary Search Tree and an integer k. We need to return the kth smallest value in the tree.
Because of the properties of BSTs, performing an in-order traversal will yield the elements in sorted (ascending) order.

**Match**
This problem matches well with:

Tree traversal problems

In-order traversal to get sorted values

Array index access to retrieve the kth value

Data Structure: Binary Search Tree
Pattern: Depth-First Search (In-order Traversal)
