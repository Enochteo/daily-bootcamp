## Delete Node in a BST
Understand:
The problem is to delete a node in a BST and replace that node with its appropriate value

Match:
This involves binary search operations + binary tree + recursion

Plan:
- We would have to search for the node we want to delete using binary search and then perform the deletion operation on that node
- Deletion means if the node has:
    - No children: replace with None
    - One child: replace with that child
    - Two children: you have to find the leftmost child of the right subtree and replace the node with that.

Implement: 
- base case (if the root is none return none)
- if the root is greater than the key, then the left node is changed to the result of passing the delete function with the left node
- vice verse for less than
