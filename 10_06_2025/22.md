The problem states to gennerate all possible combinations of open and closing parentheses following these rules:
- both (open and close parenthesis) must be of length n
- an open parenthesis must be closed by a respective parenthesis 

**Match**
The problem involves knnowledge fromm stacks and backtracking/dfs.

**Plan**
The plan is to create every combination of n open annd closed parenthesis using backtracking(recursion).

**Implement**
- we would need an helper function (recursive caller)
