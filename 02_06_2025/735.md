## Asteroid Collision - Medium
### Leetcode 75

Understand
We are to check for possible asteroid collisions and determine what happens. A collision can only occur if the previous asteroid was moving in the right direction and the next one is moving in the left direction.

Match
This problem is a stack problem because we would be dealing with either pushing or removing at the last index depending on the state.
