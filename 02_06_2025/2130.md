## Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List - Medium
## Leetcode 75

Understand:
The question says to match a node with its twin. According to the formula a twin of a node is its mirror node from reverse. All nodes before the middle of a list have a twin.

Match:
This is a linked list problem.

Plan:
Brute: we would convert the list into an array and then return the max twin sums
Optimized: we find the middle of the list. Then reverse the nodes from after that. Then we add the values of each corresponding/respective node except the middle and return the maxSum
