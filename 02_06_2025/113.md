### Path Sum II
Understand:
The question is a continuation of Path Sum I, but instead of returning a boolean, we return a list of all root to leaf paths with targetSum.

Match:
The question is a binary tree question and has to do with Depth First Search. I used pre-order traversal.

Plan:
the plan is to generate each node path and if we get one with a sum of TargetSum we add to a list.
