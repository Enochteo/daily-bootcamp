## Longest Repeating Character Replacement
**Understand**
The problem is to return the length of the longest substring in a string with repeating characters if you can only swap k characters in the substring.

Input: "AABAAABB", k = 1
Outpu:  6, you swap the first B to an A

**Match**
The problem involves sliding window with hash table to store the repeating char frequency and also so we don't have to check substrings of chars we have already checked for.
