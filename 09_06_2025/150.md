## Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation - Neetcode 150 Medium
**Understand**
The problem was to evaluate the result value of a list based on the numbers and operators in the list.
Input: A list of string literals representing operators and the numbers to be operated on.
Output: The resulting value of the list after all the operations have been made

Run through:
["2","3","+","4","5","*","+]
first we compute -> 2+3 = 5
then we compute -> 4*5 = 20
then we compute -> 5 + 20 = 25 = Output

**Match**
The problem is a data structure problem involving stacks. The way it works is that each operator operates on the last two numbers or expressions (results of a previous operations), which is why we have to use a stack data structure (we could easily use the pop function for most recent operation).

**Plan**
The plan is to iterate over the list and as we iterate append each value to a stack, but when we get to
