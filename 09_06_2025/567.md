## Permutation in String Neetcode 150 Medium
**Understand**
We are given two strings and asked two check if there is a permutation (arrangement or rearrangement) of the first string in the second string.
e.g
Input: adc, vtuadcsfg
Output: Boolean on whether or not adc or any of its permutations acd, dac, dca, cad, cda occurs in the second string.

**Match**
The problem involves sliding window and hash tables.

**Plan**
Actually, we could sort the first string and check whether or not it exists in the sorted version of the second string, but this is very brute force as it works in O(N^2logn) time, which is entirely innefficient.
