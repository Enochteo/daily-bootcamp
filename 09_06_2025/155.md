## Min Stack - Neetcode 150 Medium
**Understand**:
The problem is to just code out the implementation of a stack data structure, but with a catch, we want to get the min value at O(1) time.

Input: Operations and values
stack.push(1), stack.push(2), stack.push(3), stack.pop(), stact.top(), stack.getMin()

Output: 2,1

**Match**
The problem needs understanding from design, Stacks and Arrays.

**Plan**:
For this problem the other operations are easily implementable, but if we want to get the minimum value at constant time, we might have to sacrifice space.
Understanding: For an array with only one value, the minimum value is that value, once we add a new value, the minimum value would be the lesser of the two.
