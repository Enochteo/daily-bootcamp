## Equal Row and Column Pairs — UMPIRE Strategy
 Understand the Problem
Given a square n x n grid, count how many row-column pairs are exactly equal (element-wise).

Match the Problem Type
This is a 2D array traversal and dictionary counting problem. We're matching sequences (rows vs columns).


P — Plan a Solution
Store each row as a tuple in a dictionary with its count.

Transpose the grid using zip(*grid) to access columns.

For each column tuple, if it exists in the row dictionary, add its count to the result.
