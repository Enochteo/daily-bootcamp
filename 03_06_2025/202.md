## Happy Number - Easy
Understand:
We are to keep squaring each digit of the input number and summing it to replace it as the new number and if the result ever equals 1, it is a happy number and we return True if not we return False.

Match:
The problem would involve math and hash set and string

Plan:
Square each digit and replace the number with the sum and keep doing this until the number equals 1, if it doesn't then it continues in an endless cycle. The catch is that if we ever encounter a number we have seen before, we know it would continue in an endless cycle so we just return False from there.
