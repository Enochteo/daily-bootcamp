## Dota2 Senate
Understand:
The problem was to simulate rounds of senators exercising their rights based on some rules and predicting the winner.
e.g "RRDDRR" - R wins, so output "Radiant".

Match:
The question involves removing and operaiting (i.e the excercise of each senator's right) in FIFO so we use a queue.
