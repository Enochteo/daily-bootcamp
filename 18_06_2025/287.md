## Find the Duplicate Number
**Understand**
You are given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
There is only one repeated number, but it may be repeated more than once.
Your goal is to return the duplicate number, without modifying the array (ideally) and using constant extra space.

**Match**
This problem is about finding duplicates under constraints:

Values are constrained to [1, n] â€” this suggests index-based strategies or cycle detection.

The simplest method is to sort the list and look for two adjacent equal numbers.

Your current solution:

Sorts the array and then compares each element to its next.

Returns the first value where nums[i] == nums[i+1].

**Plan**
Sort the input array.

Loop through the array.

If the current element is equal to the next one, return it as the duplicate.
