## Find the Duplicate Number
Understand
You are given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
There is only one repeated number, but it may be repeated more than once.
Your goal is to return the duplicate number, without modifying the array (ideally) and using constant extra space.
