## Add Two Numbers
**Understand**
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

The digits are stored in forward order, with each node containing a single digit.

You must return the sum as a linked list, also in forward order.

You may not modify the input lists, meaning you can't reverse them in place.

**Match**
This is a variation of the classic "Add Two Numbers" problem, except:

The digits are in most significant to least significant order.

Since linked lists are singly linked, we canâ€™t traverse backwards.

A natural approach is to simulate backward traversal using two stacks to reverse the order.
