## Add Two Numbers
**Understand**
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

The digits are stored in forward order, with each node containing a single digit.

You must return the sum as a linked list, also in forward order.

You may not modify the input lists, meaning you can't reverse them in place.

**Match**
This is a variation of the classic "Add Two Numbers" problem, except:

The digits are in most significant to least significant order.

Since linked lists are singly linked, we canâ€™t traverse backwards.

A natural approach is to simulate backward traversal using two stacks to reverse the order.

**Plan**
Traverse both input lists and push each digit onto a stack (stack1 and stack2).
This gives us the digits in reverse order so we can perform normal addition.

Pop from each stack to reconstruct the full numbers as strings.

Convert the strings to integers, add them, and convert the result to a string.

Create a new linked list by reversing the digits of the result string and inserting node by node.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        stack1 = []
        stack2 = []
        
        current = l1
        while current:
            stack1.append(current.val)
            current = current.next
        
        current = l2
        while current:
            stack2.append(current.val)
            current = current.next
        
        num1 = ""
        num2 = ""
        for i in range(len(stack1)-1, -1, -1):
            num1 += str(stack1[i])
        for i in range(len(stack2)-1, -1, -1):
            num2 += str(stack2[i])
        
        total = int(num1) + int(num2)
        
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy
        for char in reversed(str(total)):
            current.next = ListNode(int(char))
            current = current.next
        
        return dummy.next
```
