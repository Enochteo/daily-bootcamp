## Problem: Remove Nth Node From End of List
**Understand**
Given a singly linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of the list and return its head.
Extra info:
- The list contains at least 1 node.

- The value of n is always valid (1 ≤ n ≤ list length).

- You must maintain the original order of the list.


**Match**
This problem fits classic linked list pointer manipulation and is often solved with either:

Two-pass approach: Find the length first, then locate the node.
One-pass with two pointers: Keep a gap of n between fast and slow pointers.

This solution uses the two-pass method:

Count total number of nodes.

Use that count to find and skip the target node.


**Plan**
Traverse the list to count the number of nodes.

If n == total, it means we remove the first node — handle this case directly.

Start a second traversal from the head.

When you reach the node just before the one to delete, update its next pointer to skip the target node.
