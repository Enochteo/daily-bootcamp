## Copy List with Random Pointer
**Understand**
We are given a linked list where each node has two pointers:

next: points to the next node in the list.

random: points to a random node in the list (or None).

The goal is to return a deep copy of the list, where:

All nodes are new instances (not shared with the original).

The next and random structure is preserved exactly as in the original.

**Match**
This is a linked list cloning problem with an added challenge: the random pointers can jump arbitrarily.
To properly clone the list, we need to:

Ensure every original node has a corresponding new node.

Set the next and random pointers in the new nodes to match the original structure.

The best tool for this is a hash map (dictionary) that maps original nodes to their clones.

**Plan**
Traverse the original list and create a clone for each node.
Store the mapping original_node -> cloned_node in a dictionary.

Traverse the list again, and for each node:

Set clone.next = clone of original.next

Set clone.random = clone of original.random

Return the head of the cloned list using node_mapper[head].

Implement
```python
class Solution(object):
    def copyRandomList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: Node
        :rtype: Node
        """
        node_mapper = {None: None}
        current = head

        # First pass: create clone nodes and map them
        while current:
            node_mapper[current] = Node(current.val)
            current = current.next

        current = head
        # Second pass: assign next and random pointers
        while current:
            node_mapper[current].next = node_mapper[current.next]
            node_mapper[current].random = node_mapper[current.random]
            current = current.next

        return node_mapper[head]
```
