## Copy List with Random Pointer
**Understand**
We are given a linked list where each node has two pointers:

next: points to the next node in the list.

random: points to a random node in the list (or None).

The goal is to return a deep copy of the list, where:

All nodes are new instances (not shared with the original).

The next and random structure is preserved exactly as in the original.
