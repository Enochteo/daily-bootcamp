## Koko Eating Bananas Neetcode 15
**Understand**
Koko loves bananas and has piles of bananas, each pile containing piles[i] bananas. She eats at a constant speed of k bananas/hour. She has h hours to eat all the bananas.
You need to find the minimum integer speed k such that she can eat all the bananas in h hours.

Key constraints:
She can only eat from one pile per hour.
She always eats exactly k bananas/hour (or the remaining pile if it’s smaller than k).
You return the smallest possible k such that all bananas are eaten in h hours.

**Match**
Search problem over a range -> Binary Search is appropriate

You are searching for the minimum speed k such that a condition is true (Koko eats all in ≤ h hours)

This is a classic binary search on answer space problem
